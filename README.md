Misconception AI Detector is an intelligent educational application that identifies and corrects conceptual misunderstandings by analyzing how students think—not just what they answer. Using generative AI, the system diagnoses flawed reasoning patterns and delivers targeted explanations that help learners build accurate and durable understanding.

Why Misconception AI Detector?

Most learning tools evaluate correctness.
This project focuses on reasoning quality.

Students often fail not due to lack of study, but because they develop incorrect mental models. Misconception AI Detector addresses this gap by detecting misconceptions early and correcting them with clear, structured feedback.

Core Features

Reasoning-Based Analysis
Detects conceptual misunderstandings rather than only marking answers right or wrong.

Targeted Corrective Feedback
Explains why the reasoning is incorrect and how to fix it.

Memory & Reinforcement Tips
Provides short, practical tips to prevent recurring mistakes.

Modern, Clean UI
Distraction-free interface designed for learning clarity.

Extensible Architecture
Built to support future features such as adaptive learning and analytics.

How It Works

Study material or conceptual questions are provided

Students submit short-response answers

The AI analyzes underlying reasoning patterns

Misconceptions are identified and named

Correct explanations and memory tips are generated

Tech Stack

This project uses a modern, maintainable frontend stack:

Vite – Fast development and optimized builds

TypeScript – Type safety and long-term maintainability

React – Component-based UI architecture

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling

shadcn/ui – Accessible, reusable UI components
